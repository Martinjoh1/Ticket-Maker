## Purpose

The Theater department has been keeping track of their tickets by hand for a very long time. We know that this is mostly inefficient, and and can lead to a lot of inaccuracy. This was confirmed by the department chair when she asked if something could be done about the situation currently at hand. As a result, we are seeking to build an embedded system that will help them record ticket trends, as well as create tickets electronically, which they can then print physically. 

## Initial Design Plan

The initial plan is to be able to write a python script that the Raspberry Pi can execute. The script will provide the user with a menu that will allow them to purchase a ticket based on their status as well as the number of total tickets they need. The status of the customer or user determines the price of the ticket and also allows the theater department to keep records of the ticket classification and trends. After the necessary information is collected through the options provided in the script, they are then put together to make an electronic ticket. The electronic ticket is then saved and printed into an actual ticket.


### Hardware Design
- List the hardware components you'll be using, and how they interact. 

* Inateck Barcode Scanner: scans the unique barcode generated on the physical ticket to check if ticket is valid
* Brother QL-700 Label Printer: prints the physical ticket when ready
* Raspberry Pi: acts as the central sytem to which the scanner and printer will be hooked. this also executes the ticket program

![Ticket_Program_Diagram](images/example.png "A sample image. This is the text that appears.")

### Software Design
- List all of the classes and functions you'll be creating.
  - Your program must follow good coding standards. 
  Primarily, I mean your code should include meaningful functions 
  and appropriate variables, and be formatted and commented well. 
  - If your programming language supports classes use them. *Classes are expected* to be well-designed and used throughout, if possible.
  - Sloppy code with no structure will be penalized. 

This is an excellent place for a CRC card or two.

### Data Design
- Describe your data that will be saved on your device. In particular:
  - Describe the data itself (e.g., temperature), 
  - The frequency of the data saves (e.g., constant, minute, hour), 
  - The resolution of the data (e.g., calibrated, relative change)

A sample (i.e., table) of the data would likely make this section clearest.

### Additional Requirement
- Project 3 requires an additional requirement. Describe what additional component you will take on here. 
Thoroughness is encouraged! Explain how your addition moves the project closer to "final product". 
Pictures always help, too.

## Delegation of Tasks

- John Martin: Will work on getting card scanner to create ticket 

- Rofy Ray: Will work on making card scanner to send the ticket 

- Aaron Christson: will work on finding trends in ticket collection based on needs of the department

- Lakshiya Indreswaran: Will work on infrared implementation for counting tickets

## Files

N/A

## Instructions
Explain how to use your product. 
This section should THOROUGHLY describe its usage (i.e., more than just "Push start").

## Errors and Constraints
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of
all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your product. 
Also, list any constraints that must exist for your product to work 
(e.g., Only works in low light situations).

## Summary and Reflection
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project.*

Write 3 - 5 paragraphs on your reactions to the final project. 
Your reflection should be thoughtful and reflective. 
First, report on what you did. Then, reflect on those actions. 
It's a look back at what you learned by doing this project, but good and bad. 
You should be critical of shortcomings (yours, as well as the instructors/assignments) 
as well as celebratory of what was achieved.

## Final Self-Evaluations
*You'll complete this part at the end of the project. 
Assign points to each team member in each category, based on their contribution to the team. 
The sum of all member's points in each category cannot exceed 10. 
For example, for Coding, Partner 1 could get 7 points, and Partner 2 gets 3 points. 
You can't give both people 6 points each though, as the sum exceeds 10.

**A Note from Scott to You**

While I expect this project to be challenging, one
thing to keep in mind is HAVE FUN with it! Create a product that
expresses your personal interests. Break up the writing so itâ€™s not so burdensome.
We will have a live demo sessions at the end of the project to celebrate your accomplishments.
